			<h4>Early Life</h4>
			<p>She is the daughter of a seamstress and a farmer, her mother not being able to work regularly due to her incredible, <strong>11</strong> siblings. Any money that her father(the farmer and main bread winner) could bring in was spread thin between all those hungry mouths. She grew up in the town of Bamby and was far from the luxuries of any major city. As she grew older she never took to school but was an outstanding member of the choir and could play four instruments, and by the age of 9 she co-wrote a song that went on to win awards nationally as well as regionally, she was a creative prodigy. This is around the time when she claimed to begin to develop her unique style called <em>SoHo</em>. She would go on to win many awards as a child and achieve a lot of success.</p>

				<h4>SoHo</h4>
				<p>This Trinidadian musical genre or style called SoHo is used by many local, regional and even international artists but popularized in Trinidad and Tobago and more specifically popularized by PoP and to a lesser extent Malcom Ranger(&amp;). The style is marked by a slow pace of music and singing which quickens and slows again interchangably with time.</p> 
			</article>
			<br>
			<h4>Adult life and Present</h4>
			<p>During her 18th year of life is when SoHo took hold and became mainstream. A wealthy investor offered her around that time &euro;5,000,000 for her entire catolouge of SoHo songs. She then went on to be the most awarded female artist based in the Caribbean by age 25. But all was not as it may have appeared as in what could be considered the peak of her career, her family sued her for a sizeable protion of her estate claiming that they had not recieved fair compensation for aiding her during her early years before she really broke through.</p>
